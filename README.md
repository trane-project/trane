Trane is an automated learning system for acquiring complex skills. Think of it like a system to
progress through a video game character's skill tree while making sure all of your previously
mastered skills are kept up to date, but applied to arbitrary skills. Trane is based on the
principles of spaced repetition, mastery learning, and chunking.

If you want to see it in action, head over to
[trane-cli](https://github.com/trane-project/trane-cli) for the command-line interface and to the
list of [official courses](https://trane-project.github.io/official_courses.html) to download some
courses you can use to test it out.
