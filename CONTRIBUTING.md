# Contributing

At the moment, I don't really need code contributions for this repository, as the code is mostly
complete for the time being. However, feel free to contribute to any of the repositories containing
courses. You can access those by going to the organization page. Look for the CONTRIBUTING.md file
in those repositories to find out ways to help. 

Feel free to open an issue if you have a feature request, find a bug, or notice an issue with my
usage of Rust (this is my first real project using the language).
