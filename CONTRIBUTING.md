# Contributing

At the moment, I don't really need code contributions for this repository. The code is mostly
complete for the time being and won't undergo big changes in the core logic until I get feedback
both from my use and others'. However, feel free to contribute to any of the repositories listed in
the Trane Project's [organization page](https://githug.com/trane-project). These include at the
moment the command line interface and the official courses. Look for the CONTRIBUTING.md file in
those repositories to find out more specific ways to help. 

Feel free to open an issue if you have a feature request, find a bug, or notice an issue with
usage of Rust (this is my first real project using the language).
