# Contributing

At the moment, I am not accepting code contributions for this repository, as I would like to keep
full control of the project for the time being. However, feel free to contribute to any of the other
repositories listed in the Trane Project's [organization page](https://githug.com/trane-project).
These include at the moment the command line interface and the official courses. Look for the
CONTRIBUTING.md file in those repositories to find out more specific ways to help. 

Feel free to open an issue if you have a feature request, find a bug, or notice an issue with
usage of Rust (this is my first real project using the language).
