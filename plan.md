# Improvement Plan

- Use the days since the last trial as a weighting factor for the score of a unit, so that units
  that haven't been practiced in a while are more likely to be selected.
- Now that scoring and reward propagation are in a better state, make the rewards last longer. Also,
  some kind of reward auto cleanup.
