# Improvement Plan

- Lower passing score and select a fraction of the exercises from units with scores that are just
  above that passing score and all the exercises from units with scores that approach 5.0. The
  passing / non-passing decision stops being binary and becomes a spectrum.
- Use the days since the last trial as a weighting factor for the score of a unit, so that units
  that haven't been practiced in a while are more likely to be selected.
- Now that scoring and reward propagation are in a better state, make the rewards last longer. Also,
  some kind of reward auto cleanup.
